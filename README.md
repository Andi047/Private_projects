## Makrosprache

### C-ISA

Based of the idea of making assembler more easily to understand for beginners,
```C-ISA``` uses the power of ```C``` Makros to create a meta language. This way,
one may use Mnemotics to write in a assembler-like syntax but create ```C``` code.

One big advantage is that there is no need for a simulator or emulator.


### C-easy

Another idea: pseudo code is here realised by using makros in the german language.
Useful for beginners and much better than the alternative ```Python``` which by
all means is near pseudo code, but has a lot of problems.

C-easy solves that, by forcing strict typing, use of dedicated loop variables
and a straightforward approach.
